**System Name**: Gemini VideoSync Framework (GVF)

**Objective**: 
- Summarize YouTube videos with high accuracy, capturing key points, themes, and actionable insights.
- Develop sophisticated frameworks or systems based on video content, tailored to user-defined contexts (e.g., audience, purpose, tone).
- Ensure context-aware, multimodal processing (text, audio, metadata) for comprehensive analysis.
- Optimize for efficiency, scalability, and user customization.

**Core Functionalities**:
1. **Video Input Processing**:
   - Accept YouTube video URLs as input.
   - Retrieve video metadata (title, description, duration) using yt-dlp or YouTube Data API.
   - Extract transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API or generate them via speech-to-text if unavailable.
   - Process audio for tone, sentiment, and emphasis detection to enhance summary context.
   - Optionally analyze visual elements (if API supports) for additional context (e.g., on-screen text, visuals).

2. **Summarization Engine**:
   - Generate concise summaries (100-300 words, adjustable) capturing key points, arguments, and insights.
   - Use Gemini 2.5 Pro’s reasoning capabilities to prioritize relevant information based on video content and user context.
   - Support multiple summary formats (e.g., bullet points, narrative, executive summary) based on user preference.
   - Handle edge cases: no subtitles, live videos, or multilingual content by leveraging audio processing and translation capabilities.

3. **Framework/System Development**:
   - Analyze summarized content to identify actionable components (e.g., steps, concepts, workflows).
   - Generate structured frameworks (e.g., process models, decision trees, learning plans) tailored to user-specified goals (e.g., educational curriculum, business strategy).
   - Incorporate context-aware elements, such as audience knowledge level (beginner, expert), domain (e.g., tech, education), or intended application (e.g., implementation, research).
   - Output frameworks in formats like JSON, markdown, or visual diagrams (using external tools like Mermaid or Graphviz).

4. **Context Awareness**:
   - Adapt outputs based on user inputs for audience (e.g., students, professionals), tone (e.g., formal, conversational), and purpose (e.g., learning, reporting).
   - Use metadata and content analysis to infer video context (e.g., educational, promotional, tutorial).
   - Allow iterative refinement of summaries/frameworks based on user feedback.

5. **Error Handling and Optimization**:
   - Validate video URLs and handle private, restricted, or subtitle-less videos gracefully.
   - Optimize token usage to stay within Gemini API limits (e.g., 32,000 tokens/minute for Gemini 1.5 Pro).[](https://www.nathanonn.com/how-to-summarize-youtube-video-for-free-using-gemini-api/)
   - Cache frequently accessed transcripts or metadata to reduce API calls.
   - Provide fallback mechanisms (e.g., manual transcript input) for unsupported videos.

**Prompting Guidelines**:
- For summarization: Use clear, structured prompts like: "Summarize the key points of this YouTube video [URL] in 150 words, focusing on [topic/domain], tailored for [audience], in a [tone] tone."
- For framework development: Use prompts like: "Based on the summary of this YouTube video [URL], create a [framework type, e.g., workflow, model] for [purpose, e.g., implementing a process], tailored for [audience] with [specific requirements]."
- Incorporate user feedback: Allow users to refine outputs with follow-up prompts like: "Refine the summary to include more details on [specific aspect]."

**Output Format**:
- Summaries: Structured text (e.g., markdown with sections for key points, themes, and insights).
- Frameworks: JSON, markdown, or visual diagram code (e.g., Mermaid syntax).
- Include metadata: Video title, duration, publication date, and summary/framework generation timestamp.

**Constraints**:
- Adhere to Gemini API usage limits (e.g., 50 requests/day for free tier).[](https://www.nathanonn.com/how-to-summarize-youtube-video-for-free-using-gemini-api/)
- Ensure compliance with YouTube’s Terms of Service and Google’s API policies.
- Maintain privacy by not storing sensitive user data without consent.

**Performance Metrics**:
- Accuracy: Summaries must capture 90%+ of key points (validated against manual review).
- Relevance: Frameworks must align with user-specified context and video content.
- Efficiency: Process videos within 10-30 seconds for summaries, 30-60 seconds for frameworks (depending on length).
- Scalability: Handle batch processing of up to 10 videos in a single session.

**Integration Points**:
- Use YouTube Transcript API for transcript extraction.
- Leverage yt-dlp for metadata extraction.
- Integrate with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.
- Optionally use LangChain for chaining summarization and framework generation tasks.
- Support export to formats like PDF, JSON, or markdown for user convenience.

**Security and Privacy**:
- Store API keys securely using environment variables or a .env file.
- Do not cache video content or transcripts unless explicitly permitted by the user.
- Comply with Google’s privacy policies and YouTube’s data usage guidelines.

**Dependencies**:
- Python libraries: `youtube_transcript_api`, `streamlit`, `google-generativeai`, `yt-dlp`.
- Optional: `langchain` for advanced prompt chaining, `pydub` for audio processing.
- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI and Gemini API enabled.

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Clone the repository or set up a new Python project.
2. Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure Google API key in a `.env` file: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key`.
4. Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.
5. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`.

**Example Workflow**:
1. User inputs a YouTube URL and specifies context (e.g., "Summarize for students, create a study guide framework").
2. System retrieves transcript and metadata, processes with Gemini 2.5 Pro.
3. Outputs a 150-word summary and a JSON-based study guide with key concepts, questions, and resources.
4. User refines the output via follow-up prompts if needed.
